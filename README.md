# DSJHU01

we will use this repo as a primary source for information and track of challenges that we will have in the team


For this session we will be using the weather dataset used to answer the quizz from week 1. It can be downloaded from the datasource folder in this repository

This week consists of 15 questions. These questions are to be submitted with a push to github with the code used, and if applicable, the answer (output). The time of the push will be considered as tue submit time, hence the winner will be whoever submitted the correct code/answer faster.

Next are the questions:

1) What are the dimensions (number of rows and number of columns) of the data?

2) What is the name of the last column?

3) For the same column, what is it's datatype?

4) What are the 50th values (values in line 50)?

5) Remove from the data all records with NA in the first column.

6) What are the 50th values now (values in line 50)?

7) Remove all incomplete cases from the dataset (row with an NA in any column)

8) What are the new dimensions? 

9) Get the date (day and month) with the highest Ozone value.

10) Create a subset with only the 7th and 9th months.

11) What is the average temperature in this subset?

12) What is the average temperature of the fridays in this subset?

13) Get the wind's average, min, 25th pertencile (2nd quartile), median, 75th percentile (3rd quartile) and maximum values of the complete cases in the 5th and 8th month.

14) Get the wind's average, min, 25th pertencile (2nd quartile), median, 75th percentile (3rd quartile) and maximum values of the complete cases in the 5th and 8th month, exxcept mondays.


all the best!
